# docker-terraform-gcp-dojo

[Dojo](https://github.com/kudulab/dojo) docker image with [Terraform](https://terraform.io), Go, gcloud and supporting tools installed.
Based on golang Debian docker image.

## Usage
1. Setup docker.
2. Install [Dojo](https://github.com/kudulab/dojo) binary.
2. Build this image:
```
docker build . -t terraform-gcp-dojo
```
3. Provide a Dojofile:
```
DOJO_DOCKER_IMAGE="terraform-gcp-dojo:latest"
```
4. Create and enter the container by running `dojo` at the root of project.
5. Work with terraform as usual:
```bash
terraform --version
terraform init
terraform plan
```

By default, current directory in docker container is `/dojo/work`.

## Specification

 * base image is Debian - compiling Golang under Alpine is a PITA
 * terraform binary on the PATH
 * terraform plugins: gcp, null, external, local, template, random.
 * `jq` to parse JSON from bash scripts
 * `dot` to generate infrastructure graphs from terraform
 * a minimal ssh and git setup - to clone terraform modules
 * gcloud - if ~/.config/gcloud is found it is copied to /home/dojo/.config/gcloud

### Configuration
Those files are used inside the docker image:

1. `~/.ssh/` -- is copied from host to dojo's home `~/.ssh`
1. `~/.ssh/config` -- will be generated on docker container start. SSH client is configured to ignore known ssh hosts.
1. `~/.config/gcloud/` -- is copied from host to dojo's home `~/.config/gcloud` (excpet the logs folder)
2. `~/.gitconfig` -- if exists locally, will be copied
3. `~/.profile` -- will be generated on docker container start, in
   order to ensure current directory is `/dojo/work`.

To enable debug output:
```
OS_DEBUG=1 TF_LOG=debug
```

## Development

### Dependencies
* Bash
